# text-to-binary

Here is the Javascript code written in Node.js to convert text to binary with just one line of code. I had to develop a text to binary converter for the project, I checked online but could not find a proper package for the same. So, I decided to write code and develop a package.

## Installation

```bash
npm i text-to-binary --save
```

## Usage
Just install this node.js package and import the library from node modules.

- This library from Node.js lets you convert from text to binary easily. Get all the special characters, numbers and ASCII values converted into binary easily.

Convert text to binary:
```python
var text = require('text-to-binary1')
let a = "A";
text.texttobinary(a);
